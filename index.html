<h1 id="Background">Background</h1>
<p>This past semester, I had the opportunity to evaluate how my online practices intertwine with digital data. Specifically, how different social media platforms affect my emotion. Further, I designed a data visualization and evaluated how my digital data resonates with a social issue. This webpage conveys this process and what I have learned.</p>

<h1 id="DataCOllection">Data Collection</h1>
<p>The first assignment was data collection where I analyzed and recorded how different social media platforms affect my different emotions.The three social media platoforms were Instagram,Facebook and Snapchat while the different emotions were Laughter,Excited,Happiness,Neutral,Sad,Jealous,Stressed. Over the span of one week, every time I would look at the different platforms I would record how long I was on the platform, where I was when I was viewing social media, the device I was viewing the sites from, my reason for using the app, what I saw, how different post made me feel including notes as to why I felt the way I did and the relationship to the person who posted. Below is the complete data collection spreadsheet for more information:

<h1 id="DataVisualization">Data Visualization</h1>
<p>In order to further analyze my data, I designed a categorical graph data visualization using Inkscape. The ranges of emotion are placed on the X-axis while the social media platform is on the y-axis. The color key defining relationsips is located at the top left corner. When comparing the different data points and clusters I discovered that the main variable that had an affect on my emotion was relationship to the person who posted. The more distant the relationship, the more impact they had on my emotion whether swaying positive or negative. FOr more detailed information, please see the chart below:<p>

<h1 id="Explain">Explained Data-Story Video</h1>
<p>The final stage of my data analysis is a video explaining how my digital data resonates with a social issue, specifically Data Brokerage. Data Brokerage is further defined in the video as well as the positive and negatives. I have also included my personal opinion on data brokerage based on the knowledge I gained this semester on digital data. To view the video for more information, please click on the following link:
