<h1 id="Background">Background</h1>
<p>This past semester, I had the opportunity to evaluate how my online practices intertwine with digital data. Specifically, how different social media platforms affect my emotion. Further, I designed a data visualization and evaluated how my digital data resonates with a social issue. This webpage conveys this process and what I have learned.</p>

<h1 id="DataCOllection">Data Collection</h1>
<p>The first assignment was data collection where I analyzed and recorded how different social media platforms affect my different emotions.The three social media platoforms were Instagram,Facebook and Snapchat while the different emotions were Laughter,Excited,Happiness,Neutral,Sad,Jealous,Stressed. Over the span of one week, every time I would look at the different platforms I would record how long I was on the platform, where I was when I was viewing social media, the device I was viewing the sites from, my reason for using the app, what I saw, how different post made me feel including notes as to why I felt the way I did and the relationship to the person who posted. Below is the complete data collection spreadsheet for more information:
